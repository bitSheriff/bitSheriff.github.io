title: DevLog

_DevLog_ (short for _Development Log_) is a series of posts where I write about my personal projects, my learning journey, and other things that I find interesting. The goal of this series is to document my progress, share my thoughts, and hopefully inspire others to start their own projects.

So these posts are more personal and less formal than my other posts, like tutorials. So maybe do not copy my doing 1:1 because it maybe leads in a complete wrong direction....
