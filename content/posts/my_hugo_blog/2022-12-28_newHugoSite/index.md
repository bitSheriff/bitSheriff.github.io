## What is Hugo?

Hugo is a static site generator written in Go. It is fast, easy to use and has a lot of features. It is also very popular and has a lot of themes and plugins.

## Why switching to Hugo?

Well this is a good question. I used since the beginning of this blog the static site generator [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) in combination with _github pages_. This setup was not bad at all, but I wanted to step up a bit and use more modern and more powerful tool. So my choice fell on [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

I want to thank [Nuno Coração](https://github.com/nunocoracao) for the great [Blowfish Theme](https://nunocoracao.github.io/blowfish/) I am using. It looks wonderful, is open source, has a lot of features and is furthermore customizable **but** at the same moment very easy to use.

## New Era of Blogging

### CoPilot and ChatGPT

{{< notice tip >}}
Probably _GitHub Copilot_ and _ChatGPT-3_ would be writing far better posts than me.
{{< /notice >}}
Well, yes. **But** what those highly developed chatbots cannot do is to keep you guys updated about my stuff and projects.

I think these new systems are not only scary, but also very promising to enhance our lives.

### DALL E

You probably recognized that something is _different_ with the background image of these (and the other) posts. I used the [DALL E](https://openai.com/blog/dall-e/) model to generate these images. I am very bad at designing such images, but I think a blog need some kind of visual attraction.

## What's next?

To be honest, I don't know. I tried blogging a few times back then, but know I hope I stick with it and start _learning in public_.
