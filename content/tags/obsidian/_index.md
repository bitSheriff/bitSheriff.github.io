_Obsidian_ is a great tool for managing notes and knowledge. It is a local-first knowledge management system that allows you to create and link notes in a way that makes sense to you. It is based on the concept of _markdown_ files, which are plain text files that can be easily read and edited with any text editor. This makes it easy to create and edit notes, and it also ensures that your notes are future-proof and can be easily accessed and shared with others.
