title: Brain Dump
---

*Brain dump* is a term used to describe the act of getting all of your thoughts out of your head. This can be done in a variety of ways, such as writing them down on paper or typing them out on a computer. The idea behind a brain dump is to clear your mind of clutter and make room for new ideas and thoughts.

So I consider *brain dump*-posts here as a place where I can write down my thoughts, ideas and other stuff which is not really a full developed post. Longer than a *micro post* (like a tweet, toot or skeet) but shorter than a full post, and less structured and informative.
