## Intro
Before every (good) project, there is a problem which requires a solution.
In this case the *problem* is that [nordVPN](www.nordvpn.com) has no gui client for linux. There is only a cli application which can be a bit complicated to
handle and if you use a VPN on a daily basis it gets very unhandy. So the only solution was to build a small tool for that. So time after time more and more features
were supported and even some which the cli application does not include.

## The official CLI
[The NordVPN application](https://nordvpn.com/de/download/linux/) for linux only supports a cli version. 

A connection can be established by choosing a country and a city.
```sh
    $ nordvpn c Austria Vienna
```
 Which countries and cities are available? Well this is not easily displayed.

 ```sh
    $ nordvpn cities [country]
```


## My GUI
*To be clear NorseVPN is only a wrapper. So it does not communicate with the NordVPN servers.*
